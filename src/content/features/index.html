<h1>Features</h1>

<h2>What Shed has</h2>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<h3>Interfaces and classes</h3>

<h3>Type parameters</h3>

<h3>Variadic type parameters</h3>

<h3>Covariant and contravariant type parameters</h3>

<h3>Sum types</h3>

<h3>Lambdas</h3>

<h3>Compilation to JavaScript</h3>

<h2>What Shed won't have</h2>

<p>A language is defined as much by the features it leaves out as the features
it includes. We explicitly avoid certain features found in other languages, usually
because they introduce extra complexity at little benefit, or they increase
ambiguity and reduce clarity in the language.</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>We believe that inheritance leads to complex code and unnecessarily large classes.
Instead of inheriting from a class and overriding specific methods to modify
behaviour, we use composition to encourage the creation of smaller classes designed to solve
smaller problems. These smaller classes can then be more easily reused and tested in isolation
from the larger problem.</p>

<h3>Function overloading</h3>

<p>We believe allowing more than one function with the same name to exist in the
same scope introduces ambiguity. To determine which instance of an overloaded
function is actually being called, you have to find an instance with a type
signature that corresponds to the arguments the function is being called with.
Furthermore, if there's more than one instance with an appropriate
type signature, the language must then decide which instance is the most
appropriate. By disallowing function overloading, we ensure that the function
being called is unambiguous.</p>

<h3>Nulls</h3>

<p>Allowing values to be null weakens the type system, since it is rarely
completely obvious whether a value could potentially be null or not during
the execution of a program. This can lead to dead code in the form of unnecessary
null checks, or broken code by incorrectly assuming a value cannot be null.
By disallowing nulls, this ambiguity is removed.</p>

<p>In the cases where a potentially null value is desirable, replacing nulls with
appropriate classes, such as <code>Option</code>, allows
cleaner code. For instance, with nulls:</p>

<pre>if name == null {
    return null;
} else {
    return trim(name);
}</pre>

<p>Using <code>Option</code>:</p>

<pre>return name.map(trim);</pre>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>A property access looks the same as a data field access,
except that getting or setting the field actually results in a method
being called. For instance, in C#:</p>

<pre>public class Person {
    private int m_Age;
    public int Age {
        get { return m_Age; }
        set { m_Age = value > 0 ? value : 0; }
    }
}

var person = new Person();
person.Age = -42;
var age = person.Age;
// age == 0
</pre>

<p>We believe this overloads the dot operator, making member accesses ambiguous.
By introducing properties, a member access could potentially be either a simple
field access that cannot fail (in the absence of nulls), or it could
be hiding a method access that can potentially do anything.</p>

<h3>Extension methods</h3>

<p>Extension methods allow functions defined outside of an interface or class
to be called as though they were methods. For instance, to define an extension
method in C#, we define a static method with the first argument prepended
with <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre>public static string Truncate(this string str, int maxLength) {
    return str.Substring(0, Math.Min(str.Length, maxLength));
}</pre>

<p>We can then call <code>Truncate</code> as though it was a member on
<code>string</code>:</p>

<pre>var truncated = "Great Scott!".Truncate(5);
// truncated == "Great"</pre>

<p>We believe this overloads the dot operator, since it can now either lookup
a member on the type, or call a function that happens to be in scope that has
been declared as an extension method. If the reordering of the object and
the method name is desirable, we believe this can be achieved without
rendering the dot operator ambiguous, for instance by using a different symbol.
In fact, using a distinct symbol removes the need to explicitly mark the function
as an extension method. For instance, using <code>|&gt;</code> (known as the
pipeline operator in F#):</p>

<pre>public static string Truncate(string str, int maxLength) {
    return str.Substring(0, Math.Min(str.Length, maxLength));
}

"Great Scott!" |> Truncate(5)</pre>

<p>Note that <code>Truncate</code> is now just an ordinary function.</p>

<h3>Partial classes</h3>

<p>We tend to find splitting the definition of a class over multiple files
to be confusing. In the situations where you might use a partial class,
we believe that creating two (or more) separate classes makes the code clearer.</p>

<h2>Maybes</h2>

<h3>Do notation</h3>
