<h1>Principles</h1>

<h2>Optimise for the reader</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, optimise for the reader of the code, not the writer.
If code is confusing or ambiguous, it can be misread leading to the
introduction of bugs. Alternatively, the reader may just give up
and write the same functionality again elsewhere, with a slightly different
set of bugs and semantics.</p>

<p>Note that having readable code is different from having code that looks nice.
The reader should be able to understand the semantics of the code so that they
can then modify it.</p>

<h2>Explicit declarations</h2>

<p>Introducing a new variable into the current scope must always explicitly
state the name for the new variable.</p>
